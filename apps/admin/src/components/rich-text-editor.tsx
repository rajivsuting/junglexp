  // This is a simplification - you'll need to parse the HTML value to Lexical state
  // or handle HTML content differently if the Editor supports it.
  // Assuming for now we pass undefined or handle initial state inside Editor if it supported HTML string
  // But based on the interface, it takes SerializedEditorState.
  // If value is HTML string, we might need a converter or just pass it if Editor was updated to handle it.

  // For now, we'll keep the interface but use the new Editor component.
  // Since the new Editor uses Lexical and outputs JSON/State, and our form expects string (HTML presumably or JSON string),
  // we need to adapt.

  // If the previous value was HTML from Tiptap, it won't directly load into Lexical without parsing.
  // However, if we are starting fresh or if the value is just stored, we need to decide on storage format.
  // If we switch to Lexical, we should store the JSON state string.
